      "Lux - the name given to you by your mother, a wet nurse at the church of Light. She thought only fitting, since all she knew was the life serving the goddess of Light. You grew up on the streets of Altivia, helping the poor and the blighted, as a servant of the church, like your family did. Your father, a monk there,  unable to cope with the sinful act of lusting after another, now lived in seclusion under the monastery, a small building in the countryside. As you grew old, you ended up exploring the city, beyond the walls of the church, discovering different religions and beliefs, different people, animals and even monsters that you could only find in the picture books you read sneaking in the library room. As days went by, you started to have an itch. That was no longer your world. The world you saw is only the tip of a needle - there was much and much more to be explored."
